## Academic/Professional Projects

### 1. Machine Learning-Based Malware Detection and Attack Challenge
*Multi-stage challenge on ML-based malware detection and adversarial evasion attacks.*  
- Built ML models for malware detection with strict constraints (≤1GB RAM, ≤5s response).  
- Developed evasive malware binaries to bypass detection, testing robustness of defense models.  
- Explored both black-box and white-box attack/defense strategies.  
- **URL:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/gnat-n/-ml-based-malware-defender-and-attack)

### 2. Improving CLIP Training (CSCE636 Deep Learning Project)
*Deep Learning project on Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP).*  
- Implemented and compared **5 loss functions** (CLIP, SogCLR, CyCLIP, VICReg, OnlineCLR).  
- Evaluated with **3 optimizers** (AdamW, SGD, Adam).  
- Trained on **CC3M subset (100k)**; validated on MSCOCO & ImageNet.  
- Results showed **CyCLIP with AdamW** achieved best average performance (16.9%).  
- **Dataset:** CC3M, MSCOCO, ImageNet
